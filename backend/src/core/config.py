    """Read the running version out of backend/pyproject.toml, as ``vX.Y.Z``.

    The version describes the *code*, not the deployment, so it must travel
    with the code. It used to default to a hardcoded string that only
    APP_VERSION in .env could override — and .env is gitignored, so a fresh
    ``git pull`` never changed it. GET /api/admin/version then compared a
    stale number against the repo's latest tag and reported an update that
    was already installed, forever. Reading pyproject.toml makes bumping the
    version a one-line change that ships with the release.

    The ``v`` is added here rather than stored in pyproject.toml: that field
    is a PEP 440 package version, where a leading ``v`` is non-canonical and
    gets stripped when building a wheel — the two spellings would drift apart
    again. Git tags are ``vX.Y.Z``, and the update dialog shows current and
    latest side by side, so one consistent spelling reaches the UI from here.
    Comparison is unaffected either way: _parse_version() ignores the prefix.

    Falls back to "0.0.0" when the file isn't there (installed as a wheel, or
    a partial copy): an unknown version should look old rather than break boot.
